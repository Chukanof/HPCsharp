# High Performance Computing in C# (HPC#)

High performance C#/.NET algorithms complimenting Linq. Gives developers the ability to easily trade-off between performance and the appropriate level of abstraction.
Lowering the level of abstraction results in higher performance. Open source.

Version 1.0 includes the following:

- Array and List.SequenceEqual() 4X faster, parallel up to 11X faster
- Array and List.Min() 1.5-3X faster
- Array and List.Max() 1.5X faster
- Expanded interface to allow a sub-range of array or List to be compared
- More standard C# algorithms to come shortly...

Additional included algorithms:

- Insertion Sort for Array and List (for fast sorting of very small arrays or Lists in-place)
- Merge of two pre-sorted Arrays or Lists
- More to come...

See HPCsharpExample folder in this repo for usage examples - a complete VisualStudio 2017 solution provided.

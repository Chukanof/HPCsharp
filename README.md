# High Performance Computing in C# (HPC#)

C#/.NET high performance parallel and sequential algorithms.

High performance versions of the standard C# Array and List algorithms provided by "using System.Linq". Version 1.0 includes the following:

- Array.SequenceEqual() 4-11X faster on quad-core CPU.
- List.SequenceEqual()  4-11X faster
- Expanded interface on SequenceEqual to allow a sub-range of array or List to be compared
- More standard C# algorithms to come shortly...

Additional algorithms:

- Insertion Sort for array and List (for fastest sorting of very small arrays or Lists)
- Merge of two pre-sorted arrays or Lists
- More to come...

See HPCsharpExample folder in this repo for usage examples - a complete VisualStudio 2017 solution provided.
